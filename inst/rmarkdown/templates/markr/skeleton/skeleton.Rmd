### Distribution of Marks

```{r}
# you can create plots dynamically
mark_dist(marks, "grade", facet_by = "question", 
          scale = c("E", "D", "C", "B", "A"))

# if the same images are used in many files 
# it is better to save them and reference like this:
# knitr::include_graphics("class_plot.png")
```
