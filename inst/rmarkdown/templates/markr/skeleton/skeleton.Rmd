* To create lists

### Distribution of Marks

```{r, fig.alt="A plot showing the distribution of marks for questions A and B. "}
# you can create plots dynamically
mark_dist(marks, "grade", facet_by = "question", 
          scale = c("E", "D", "C", "B", "A"))
```

```{r, fig.align='right', out.width="25%", fig.alt="#psyTeachR logo in rainbow colours with the words Reproducible and Research after the R"}
# if the same images are used in many files 
# it is better to save them and reference like this:
knitr::include_graphics("https://psyteachr.github.io/images/psyTeachR_logo.png")
```
